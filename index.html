                <p>The floods in Bangladesh are thought to be the most severe in 100 years. More than a third of the
                    country has been submerged. At least 115 people have died and more than 5.7 million are affected.
                    The government and NGOs are struggling to cope with the extent of the disaster and warn of risk of
                    disease as well as shortages of crucial supplies including food, medication and clean drinking
                    water. More than half a million homes have been damaged.
                    We should stand by them this time and help them.</p>
